Eric's Comet Competition

A clone of a shareware game that brought me lots of joy as a child.

# Description of the Game I intend to build

4-player game (local and/or netplay)

Each player is competing to destroy the most comets and get the highest score.

# Features

I intend to implement the things that made this so much fun to play such as inertia making the control a little wilder and shooting your oponent doesn't destroy them, it pushes them...perhas into a comet...which will destroy them.

Also, if you reach any edge of the map you reappear at the opposite side.
